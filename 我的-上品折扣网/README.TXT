First of all, what I want to stress is that it is the first complete project of my own so that we can make the version of the project 1.0. And the project is comprised of 8 file of html,including index.html, brand-list.html,my-cart.html,good-detail.html,login.html and register.html, vip-center.html, and activity.html. And the rest of files is to help them achieve functions or make more functions.
There are some functions I have tried my best to show in these file of html.Drop-down menu,show and hide of the picture, it is made with the CSS.Inaddtion,with the mode of the "XUAN XIANG KA", there are more functions finished.About the Carousel picture,I made it through the jQuery-plugin.when it comes to the files of the login and the register, their functions can be showed by the LOCALHOST.As for the brand-list, its main-content is made by the loading the data (it means the files of json) of the jQuery-ajax. The functions of my-cart.html is asked to show by working together with the brand-list.html in the context of the LOCALHOST.
The FLAW:
    1、some data about the floor of the index.html is not finished;
    2、the file about the login and register is flaewd, and some function does not be achieved;
    3、for the goods-detail.html, there are still some bugs,especailly the magnifier;
    4、as for the my-cart, the function of all-delete is not required.
NOTE: all the explanations belongs to the developer.
